# CovidDashboard
Covid-19 Dashboard Repository

This repository contains code for creating a dashboard of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccination rates in up to four different lower tier local authorities in England.

The dashboard downloads data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/, which is available under an Open Government License v3.0
