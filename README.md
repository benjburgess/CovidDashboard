# CovidDashboard
Covid-19 Dashboard Repository

This repository contains code for creating a dashboard of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccination rates in up to four different lower tier local authorities in England.

The dashboard downloads data from [UK Government Covid-19 Portal](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/), which is available under an [Open Government License v3.0]("https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/")

An [interactive version of this Covid-19 dashboard](https://benjburgess.shinyapps.io/covid19_ltla_dashboard/) is openly available.

The code for this dashboard is [openly available](https://github.com/benjburgess/CovidDashboard/blob/master/app.R)
